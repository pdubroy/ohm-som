# ohm-som

A JavaScript implementation of [SOM](http://som-st.github.io/), a minimal Smalltalk for teaching and research. Just a hobby, won't be big and professional like TruffleSOM.

⚠️ **WARNING:** Very much a work in progress. ⚠️

Right now it's just an extremely basic SOM-to-JavaScript compiler using [Ohm](https://github.com/harc/ohm).
